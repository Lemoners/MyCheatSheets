# Summary
- Searching for love to escape ourselves.
- At the end of all that love, I have nothing.
- Chasing love might be a ultimate distraction of fixing ourselves.
- Sometimes when you are focusing on that perfect romance, you are **NOT** actually doing **the real work**:
    - to fix the stuff that's stopping you from becoming happy.
- Stop dreaming about your prince or princess breaking out the door and saving you miserable life.
