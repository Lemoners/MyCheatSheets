# Me or slave?

- Indeed, everyday is a day in your life, but **some days** are just more important than others.
- We do make choices everyday, but some are just more important than others, do grub those opportunities when you can.
- YOU are **NOT** slave of yourself, you need to learn to cooperate with yourself.
- People will do things out of two purposes, one called instinct, one called command/order. Making yourself a schedule is a command, you cannot think it's obvious that YOU should follow YOUR command, it's NOT.
- You need to treat yourself as someone else, which means you need to provide yourself with pleasure as payment for work.
- When you hit the gym, it seems that you can never push yourself hard enough. Then you might get tired of it.
    - Solution: each move, ask yourself that have you give everything out? If your body says yes, then you are doing a great job!
