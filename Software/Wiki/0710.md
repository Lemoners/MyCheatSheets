# Summary
- How to stop screwing yourself over.
- Get what you want is simple, but not easy.
    - Why won't you get what you want?
    - "I'm fine."
- No one has told you to parent yourself.
    - Force to do the crap you do not want.
- Two mode for your mind:
    - Auto-pilot  +  Emergency-break
    - It's the routine that kills you.
    - Anything breaks your routine needs force, if not, you will get back to your routine soon.
- When you feel frustrated, some of your basic needs are not satisfied.
- 5 seconds: if you have an impulse to do something, while you do not do it in 5 seconds, you will kill it yourself.
