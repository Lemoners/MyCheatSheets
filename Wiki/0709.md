# Summary
- To reach beyond your limits by training your mind.
1. Your mind does exactly, specifically, **what it thinks you want it to do**.
    - "This work is too f**ked; I cannot get up."
    - If you tell your mind like that, it will make you do it that way.
    - It's not possitive thinking, it's collaborating with yourmind. (you need to say these words even it might not be true.)
    - I want this; I choose this; I'll make it.
2. Your mind is hardwired to move towards pleasure and away from pain.
    - When you don't want to start to do something hard, keep saying, I want it, I want it, I want it.
    - And you have to link it with pleasure rather than pain.
    - **Don't flee from the hard things**
3. The way you feel about everything comes down to two things: the **pictures** in your head, and the **words** you say to yourself.
    - Change the image / words in your mind.
    - e.g. don't think bad image before a public speech.
4. Your mind loves **what is familiar**.
    - What is familiar? Unfortunately, procrastination, fuck up, feel bad about ourselves.
    - You need to change those feeling by **intentially changing** what you actually want.
