# Summary
- Why I won't watch porn anymore:
    - What is sexual?
        - there is no kissing / hugging / touching ... in porn, just penatration.
        - porn is not about sex, is about man domination and woman subordination.
    - Sex with "no hand involed":
        - the only part that the man touches woman is the penis and no hands at all.
    - "I lost my ability to dream":
        - the part that does not involve with sex is actually **more important** in a relationship.
        - porn is taking away our ability to dream about this part:
            - it replaces love with penatration. 
    - How this bodily implaming between us will emerge step by step, this is **super important**.
    - Everything we watch is invading our mind.
        - Watching music show will make us want to become a singer, even if we might not want it actually.
    - Addiction and paralyzed issue.
    - Emotionally safe sex.
