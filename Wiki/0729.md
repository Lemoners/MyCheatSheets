# Don't do things which you know won't help you get better.


# Summary:
- [Better life lives in thinking forward](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1u54y1B7cA?p=2)
- You act based on what you **expect**, not what you **want**.
- Expectation + Action = Create your life experiences.
    - We actually act based on our expectation.
- You might want something, but you're not sure whether you can attain it, so you hold back.
- We used to anticipate future with our past experiences:
    - If you fail once, you might think that you're gonna fail again.
- Your belief that whether you can get what you want has a huge impact on your emotional health:
    - You might be happy and powerful when you think you can get reward.
    - You might be depressed and stressful when you don't think you're going to get what you want.
- How to deal with the gap between expectation and what you want:
    - Give up what you want, tell yourself it's not worth it.
    - Change your expectation to what you want.
- Three steps:
    - How is what I am expecting making me feel?
        - Positive or negative emotion. (If positive, stop here)
    - What would I like to have happened instead?
        - You want to win the lottery, but you don't expect to win.
    - What do I need to do to make what I want happen?
